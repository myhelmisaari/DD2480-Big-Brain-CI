# DD2480-CI
CI is the second assignment in the course DD2480 Software Engineering Fundamentals. The goal of the assignment is to implement a continuous integration server that first clones a repository on GitHub when there are any changes on it, builds the project and notifies the user. 

## Getting Started
This implementation of a CI-server is made with Java SDK 11 and IntelliJ; therefore make sure you have these installed. The project that uses the CI-server needs to have `Gradle` installed, due to it being used by the CI-server. There must exist a `build.gradle` file in the project. This file must contain the dependencies needed for the project to run.

## Testing
Tests are written using the `JUnit` library. 

## Using the CI-server
1. Go to the assessment branch
1. Make a change somewhere
1. Push changes to `GitHub`
1. The CI-server will do its part and notify about the results

## What the server is doing
1. Clone the project using `JGit`, this happens when webhook sees a change (such as a push) in the repository
1. Compile and run the test using `Gradle` and the Gradle tooling API `GradleConnector` (can be done using the command `gradlew build` in the terminal)
1. Notify the user using the `XML-file` generated by `Gradle`

## Contributing
### Branches
Each issue should be worked on separately in its own branch; issue #420 should only be worked on in the branch `issue-420`. Solutions to issues can only be merged to `master` after a successful review of a pull request.

There are two branches. One `master` and one called `assessment`, the `assessment` branch is simulating a project with a main class and a simple test for it. This is used to show the functionality of the CI-server. The `master` branch is the server part.

### Documentation
* Every method should have a `JavaDoc` comment explaining what it does, the parameters and the return value.

## Troubleshooting
### IntelliJ
If the source and test folders are not showing up in the project view, try following [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5816419/intellij-does-not-show-project-folders).
